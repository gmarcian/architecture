# Deployed Topology - Beta

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the beta based DT, then
please review the [README](../../examples/dt/uni02beta/README.md) in the examples
directory.

This directory `dt/uni02beta/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../examples/dt/uni02beta/kustomization.yaml) in
the examples directory of uni01Beta topology, reference it by path as a
component. It's contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to understand
how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
