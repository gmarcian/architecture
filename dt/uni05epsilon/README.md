# Deployment Topology â€“ Epsilon

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the Epsilon based DT,
then please see the [README](../../examples/dt/uni05epsilon/README.md)
in the examples directory.

This directory `dt/uni05epsilon/` exists so that
the [kustomization.yaml](../../examples/dt/uni05epsilon/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory of `uni05epsilon` topology can reference it by path
as a component.
